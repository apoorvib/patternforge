## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

```
bash

Copy

# Basic installation
pip install specialized-viz

# Full installation with all models
pip install specialized-viz[all]
```

## Quick Start

```
python

Copy

from specialized_viz.timeseries import (
    TimeseriesAnalysis,
    TimeseriesConfig,
    TimeseriesVisualizer,
    TimeseriesForecasting
)

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv', index_col='date', parse_dates=True)

# Initialize components
config = TimeseriesConfig(
    decomposition_method='additive',
    seasonal_periods=[5, 21, 63, 252]  # Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly
)
analyzer = TimeseriesAnalysis(data, config)
viz = TimeseriesVisualizer(analyzer)
forecaster = TimeseriesForecasting(data)

# Basic analysis
decomp_fig = viz.plot_decomposition('value')
decomp_fig.show()

# Create forecast
features = forecaster.create_features('value')
forecast = forecaster.seasonal_forecast(features, data['value'])
```

## Core Modules

### 1. TimeseriesAnalysis

- Time series decomposition
- Pattern detection
- Seasonality analysis
- Change point detection

### 2. TimeseriesVisualizer

- Interactive dashboards
- Correlation analysis
- Distribution evolution
- Feature importance visualization

### 3. TimeseriesForecasting

- Multiple forecasting models
- Feature engineering

- Online learning

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Comprehensive Analysis

```
python

Copy

# Create comprehensive dashboard
dashboard = viz.create_comprehensive_dashboard('value')
dashboard.show()

# Analyze patterns
patterns = analyzer.analyze_seasonality('value')
cycles = analyzer.analyze_cycles('value')
```

### 2. Advanced Forecasting

```
python

Copy

# Combined seasonal forecast
result = forecaster.combined_seasonal_forecast(features, target)

# Online learning with drift detection
forecaster.online_learning(features, target, window_size=63)
```

## Best Practices

1. Data Preparation
   - Ensure datetime index
   - Handle missing values
   - Use appropriate frequency
2. Model Selection
   - Use seasonal models for periodic data
   - Consider ensemble methods for complex patterns
   - Implement online learning for streaming data
3. Performance Optimization
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Use appropriate window sizes
   - Implement data downsampling when needed
